**Outreach Template:**

Hey [Name],

I'm building SocialFi - it turns viral Reddit/Farcaster posts into tradable markets. Think prediction markets but for internet content.

Would love to give you early access + 5,000 credits to try it.
If you find it interesting, a tweet would be amazing.

No pressure either way. Just think you'd appreciate the alpha 🤝

## Phase 3: Farcaster & Lens Protocol (Week 3-5)

### 3.1 Farcaster Strategy

   - Show price chart in cast
   - One-click buy/sell

3. **Channel Presence:**
   - Join: /defi, /trading, /alpha
   - Start: /socialfi channel

**Frame Implementation Priority:**
```
Frame 1: "Market Preview"

- Spam multiple subs same day

Title: "I've been trading viral posts like stocks - here's what I learned"

Body: [Genuine story about using the platform, wins and losses,
what makes it interesting, soft mention at end with link]
```

```
Title: "Built a tool that creates markets from Reddit posts - feedback wanted"

Body: [Detailed breakdown, screenshots, ask for genuine feedback,
engage with every comment]
```

### 4.3 Community Building

- Create r/SocialFiTrading subreddit

## Phase 5: Growth Hacks & Viral Mechanics (Ongoing)

### 5.1 Referral System

**Structure:**
```
Referrer: 500 credits + 5% of referee's trading fees forever
Referee: 1,500 credits (instead of 1,000)
```

**Viral Loop:**
User signs up → Gets credits → Trades → Shares wins → Refers friends → Repeat

### 5.2 Trading Competitions

**Weekly Competition:**
- "Biggest Gainer" - Most % portfolio increase

- "Early Bird" - First to find winning market

**Prizes:**
- Credits (cheap for us, valuable for users)
- NFT badges (social proof)
- Leaderboard permanent placement

### 5.3 Meme Market Events

**Concept:** When something goes viral (new meme, drama, event), we:
1. List it as market within minutes
2. Tweet about it
3. First traders get bonus credits

**Examples:**
- Celebrity drama tweet → "Will this get 1M likes?" market
- Viral TikTok → Market created
- Reddit AMA → Market on top question

### 5.4 Portfolio Sharing

**Shareable Cards:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  @username's Portfolio          │
│                                 │
│  Total Value: $X,XXX            │
│  24h Change: +XX% 📈            │
│                                 │

│  1. [Post] +150%                │
