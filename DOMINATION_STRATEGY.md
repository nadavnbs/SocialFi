# CRYPTO DOMINATION STRATEGY
## 14-Day Viral Ignition Execution Plan

---

## DAY 1: FOUNDATION DAY

### Morning (9-11 AM UTC)
**Thread 1: Origin Story**
```
🧵 I quit my 6-fig job to build this.

SocialFi turns viral content into tradable markets.

Every Reddit post, every Farcaster cast - now has a price.

Here's why this changes everything 👇

1/ The attention economy is worth $500B. But creators capture <1%.

We're fixing that.

2/ When content goes viral, traders profit. When traders profit, creators earn royalties.

The viral loop writes itself.

3/ Built secure-first:
- SIWE authentication (EIP-4361)
- Atomic trading with optimistic locking
- Rate limiting on every endpoint

No rug mechanics. Period.

4/ Try it now: [link]

1,000 credits free for every new wallet.

Find alpha before everyone else.
```

### Afternoon (2-4 PM UTC)
- Reply to 20 crypto influencer tweets with genuine takes
- Post first alpha call: "This Reddit post from r/cryptocurrency is undervalued 👀"
- DM 5 micro-influencers with early access offer

### Evening (8-10 PM UTC)
- Twitter Space: "Trading Viral Content - AMA" (30 mins)
- Discord soft launch announcement

---

## DAY 2: CONTROVERSY IGNITION

### Morning
**Thread 2: Controversial Hook**
```
🔥 Unpopular opinion:

Prediction markets failed because they're boring.

Nobody cares if Biden wins or loses.

But a viral TikTok? A Reddit AITA post? A Farcaster drama thread?

That's real engagement.

And now it's tradable.

RT if you'd rather trade memes than elections.
```

### Afternoon
**Engagement Farm Post:**
```
📊 Which viral post type would you trade first?

1️⃣ Reddit drama
2️⃣ Twitter/X ratio
3️⃣ TikTok challenge
4️⃣ Farcaster hot take

Quote tweet with your thesis 👇
```

### Action Items
- Respond to EVERY reply within 30 mins
- Create controversy by questioning prediction market leaders
- Post alpha: "Just bought into this r/technology post at 0.05. Here's why..."

---

## DAY 3: FARCASTER BLITZ

### Morning
**Warpcast Strategy**
```
gm Farcaster

1. Try SocialFi
2. Cast their first trade

```

### Frame Launch

- Direct cast to 20 Farcaster power users

### Afternoon

- Coordinate with Farcaster-native projects for cross-promotion

---

## DAY 4: ALPHA HUNTERS DAY

### Morning
**Thread 3: Trading Alpha**
```
🎯 I just made 3x on a Reddit post in 4 hours.

Here's my exact strategy:

1/ Find posts with high comment velocity but low upvotes
2/ Buy before momentum hits
3/ Sell when engagement peaks

Works on any network.

Thread with examples 👇

[Include 3 real examples with screenshots]
```

### Afternoon
- Create "Alpha Hunters" role in Discord
- Post 3 specific alpha calls with entry/exit prices
- Document wins publicly

---

### Target List

## DAY 9: LIQUIDITY THEATER

### Seed Strategy
1. Identify 5 posts about to go viral (rising velocity)
2. Place initial buys to establish price
3. Document the process publicly

### Public Transparency
```
🔍 Real-time trade log

Just bought 50 shares of [post] at $0.08

Thesis: Rising fast in r/technology, <500 upvotes but 200 comments

### Price Spike Mechanics

- Cycle repeats

## DAY 10: CROSS-PLATFORM RAID

### Reddit Campaign
**Post Title:** "I've been trading viral posts like stocks - here's my P&L"

**Body:**
```
This might sound crazy but hear me out.

There's a new platform that creates markets for viral content.

I've been testing it for 2 weeks. Here's my actual results:

[Screenshot of portfolio]

Initial: 1,000 credits
Current: 4,200 credits (+320%)

Strategy:
- Buy posts with high comment velocity
- Sell when they hit r/all
- Never hold overnight

Anyone else tried this? Looking for others to share strategies.
